## What does it do
You press a button (F by default), nearby valuable items are discovered (and shown on screen). Already discovered items are shown a second time.

If Multiplayer RPC is enabled, items discovered for the first time with the scanner will appear on both your minimap and your friends', should you be playing multiplayer.

Has a cooldown of 10 seconds, tracked on the top of the screen. Said bar shouldn't appear by itself unless scanner is used.

## Configuring
Use your modinstaller, BepInEx's config, or [REPOConfig](https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/nickklmao/REPOConfig/)
- Keybind for scanning can be changed (f by default, doesn't show up in REPOConfig)
- Scan radius can be changed (10 by default)
- Cooldown can be changed (10 by default)
- Multiplayer RPC discovery can be changed (true by default)

## Installation
1. Download the REPO Scanner Mod package.
2. Extract the contents to the game's `BepInEx/plugins` directory.
Or use [Gale](https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/Kesomannen/GaleModManager/)/[r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/ebkr/r2modman/).

## Why scan GUI ugly and not in the style of the game
Because I can't figure out how to make it render properly.
