**Additional shopping shelves with increased shop loot**

## Features
- Increased item spawn rate in the shop.
- Additional shelving for more of each item.

## Important
In the config, the "Max Amount In Shop" value should only be changed if are playing with "Max Purchase Override" toggled off (set to false).

Also, this mod does not increase the spawning of carts and pocket carts, only items.

## Potential Issues that will be addressed soon

Truck only has 16 upgrades spots, 16 small item spots, 8 large high item spots, 4 large plus item spots, 12 medium item spots, 12 health pack spots, and 4 large item spots.

There is potentially a loss of extra items, but the truck does spawn the "rest" after loading into the next level. I do plan to increase the storage in the truck.
